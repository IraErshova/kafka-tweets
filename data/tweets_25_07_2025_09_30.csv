115885,2025-07-25T09:30:06.003086,@Delta Is that not what I‚Äôve done already?
115885,2025-07-25T09:30:06.089479,@Delta Can you reply on the DM thread?
115885,2025-07-25T09:30:06.176192,@Delta I did this some time ago now but haven‚Äôt heard from you...
115885,2025-07-25T09:30:06.344372,"@Delta Actually, I just looked again and they disagree and say it's on you. Any idea what I should do? https://t.co/twIogKd3Kx"
115885,2025-07-25T09:30:06.428631,@Delta Hi - and thanks. Think I just figured this out. Would it be you‚Äôre not running the MEX-MID flight so I need to check in via AeroMexico?
115885,2025-07-25T09:30:06.598757,"@Delta I'm flying JFK-MEX-MID tomorrow and you say I'm booked in, but it looks like it's just the first leg. Can you check, please?"
115892,2025-07-25T09:30:11.248889,"@British_Airways Sure, how much would an upgrade cost, out of curiosity?"
115892,2025-07-25T09:30:11.421676,"@British_Airways Or, more importantly, are there earlier flights than the itinerary I was rebooked on? That's my preference."
115892,2025-07-25T09:30:11.506208,"@British_Airways This itinerary is preferred--I was unable to view other options in the ""Manage my Booking"" link included in the original cancelation email. https://t.co/kfddWeSW49"
